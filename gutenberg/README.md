# CA.gov Design System Gutenberg Blocks

Version 2.0.0 (DEVELOPMENT))
`@cagov/design-system-wordpress-gutenberg`

## What this plugin does

Integrates the State of [California Design System](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov) into the WordPress Gutenberg editor.

The [CA.gov](http://CA.gov) design system defines “Content Components”. 
This can be structured markup with CSS and custom elements, or interactive web components.

[Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) is an open-source editor that is included in core WordPress, version 5.0 and later. 
This editor tool allows content editors to use pre-defined markup blocks in content. 

This plugin includes only **Content components** from the CA Design System.

## How to use this plugin

- Install and enable this plugin
- This will create a WordPress Block library that is available in the Gutenberg Editor UI.
- Keep the plugin up-to-date for important security and design updates.
- Check our CHANGELOG for notifications of major updates for database updates to keep content in sync with design system changes.

## Content design and using Gutenberg Blocks

- Review guidance for content editors
    - Please also check the [principles](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/principles/) and [content principles](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/style/content/) of the design system for more information on improving content for State of California website users.
- The Office of Digital Innovation has drafted content guidance for content editors on our systems. 
    - If needed please [reach out](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/contact-us/) to the Design System team until we are able to publish the full version for any site using these Gutenberg Blocks.

## Dependencies
- Requires WordPress 5.9 or later.
- Requires core Gutenberg feature to be enabled and not blocked.

## Maintenance
- Since the Design System is in continuous development, components are continuously improved.
- All components are versioned, this means you can coordinate your update on your own schedule and test your update to make sure that everything is working well.
- Check the [maintenance](./MAINTENANCE.md) docs on how to perform an update.

## Compatible WordPress themes
- Compatible themes that implement the CA Design System
    - [CAWeb theme](https://github.com/CA-CODE-Works/CAWeb) Version (x.x.x) @TBD
    - [Design System WordPress theme](https://github.com/cagov/design-system-wordpress-theme) (DEVELOPMENT)

## Using with CAWeb theme
- We are aligning with the [CAWeb](https://github.com/CA-CODE-Works/CAWeb) State Template theme.
- This is the same codebase that will be used in the CAWeb theme. 
<!-- - (@TODO) Instructions on syncing this code with the CAWeb theme can be found at ___ -->
