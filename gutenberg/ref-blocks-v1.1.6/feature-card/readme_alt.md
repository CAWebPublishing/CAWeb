# Hero component

This is a design for featuring important content at the top of a page. The layout uses a sidebar pattern with the text elements: header, description and call to action button on the left and an image on the right. On smaller screens the image appears above the text.

## Audits

Running the lighthouse audits against this HTML & CSS should produce no issues

## Development

From the command line at the root of this project you can run:
```
npm run start
```
Which will start the web-dev server and will launch a new page linking to the components, click on hero to get the page created by ```preview.html```

### Expected variables

There are some colors that should be defined by the containing page. 

- The ```background-color``` of the CTA has a default value but if the css variable is defined

Expected definition is:

```
:root {
  --primary-color: #33705B;
}
```
