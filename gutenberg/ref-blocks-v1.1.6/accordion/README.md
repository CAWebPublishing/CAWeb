# Accordion custom Gutenberg block

The accordion custom Gutenberg block depends on the <a href="https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/components/accordion/readme/">CA design system accordion package</a>. The block provides the WordPress editor interface to add an accordion component using the WordPress visual editor and applies the appropriate markup to the source.
