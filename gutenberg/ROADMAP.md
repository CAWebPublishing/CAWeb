# ROADMAP


## 2.0.1+
- Establish a shared issue board for this project
- Address style changes from components with no base-css code
- Address issues resulting from updating Design System tokens


## Component needs
- Stop using columns, even turn them off completely - too confusing for editors & it doesn't reinforce our grid
- Media Alt support all GB blocks, requires spec coming from Design system

- Apply same template hiding filter used for pantheon template handler to CAweb template handlers
- Page feedback is hard coded in this plugin & that seems unscalble
- Delete category-template (or disable the category rendering?)
- Have a sprint that is just about WordPress code standards
- Decide on simple unit tests that could help developers to collaborate in a distributed way
- Add example of migration handling & update script (started in `updates`)
