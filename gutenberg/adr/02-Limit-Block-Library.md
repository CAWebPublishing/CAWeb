# 1. WordPress Block Automator

Date: 4/29/2022

## Status
Integrated

## Context
We noticed errors happening in our publishing systems when content editors used un-tested blocks from the default Block library.
In general, we would like to only use design system blocks - as we will be able to test, validate these blocks and make sure they are accessible, performant and translatable in our systems.


## Decision
Add cagov_ds_gutenberg_allowed_block_types with list of included components.

## Consequences







## Architectural Decision Records
Exploring this idea of embedding more long-term context in State gov github repositories.
