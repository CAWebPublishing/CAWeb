# Introduction
CAWeb Publishing is the only service to offer the latest California State Website Template on fully managed WordPress hosting with full setup and customer support. The best way to use this theme is by subscribing to the [CAWeb Publishing Service](https://cdt.ca.gov/services/caweb-publishing/). If you don't want to use the CAWeb Publishing Service you can still use the CAWeb WordPress theme. The CAWeb theme is a child theme of Divi by [Elegant Themes](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/).

# Setup
If your organization is moving to WordPress CMS, but you are not subscribing to the CAWeb Publishing Service, you'll need hosting and the State Template child theme. Here are the steps to get started:
1. [Install WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/) (takes about 5 minutes).
2. Purchase a Divi license from [ElegantThemes](https://www.elegantthemes.com/join/) and dowload the theme. Divi is the parent theme used with the CAWeb WordPress Child Theme and is required.
3. Upload the Divi Theme to your WordPress instance.
5. Download the latest release of the [CAWeb](https://github.com/CA-CODE-Works/CAWeb/releases) Theme.
